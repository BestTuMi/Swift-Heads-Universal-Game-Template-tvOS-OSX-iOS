This is a starter project to allow you to build a universal game that will run on both tvOS, iOS, and OS/X with one codebase.  

### Presentation
This is a suplimentary project to Matthew Fecher's ([@goFecher](http://twitter.com/goFecher)) presentation on Swift Game Design.

### Music

This starter template includes four (4) background music songs created as a part of another open-source Synthesizer project I am working on that will be released shortly. You are free to use these songs in any of your apps. However, you may not resell them.

### Additional Library

This starter template includes Ray Wenderlich's excellent [SKUtils Library](https://github.com/raywenderlich/SKTUtils). These routines include several helpful custom effects, math, conversion, and other useful Sprite Kit routines.
