# Universal Sprite Kit Game Template
Create a game to run on iOS, OS/X and tvOS with a single code base!
![tvOS](http://i.giphy.com/3o8dp0eJZvEuNHVlGU.gif)

This is a starter project to allow you to build a universal game that will run on:

**1. tvOS  
2. iOS  
3. OS/X**

### Notes

- This code will run on all three platforms with one code base! 
- It shares assets and scenes under the "Universal Game" folder. 
- This is meant to be a starter template. (The example gameplay is just for demonstration purposes and can easily be removed and replaced with your own code in the GameScene.swift file).
- User interactions (touches & mouse clicks) are abstracted out in the "Universal Game" section. This allows everything to be run from a shared code base.  
- **Write once, run on three platforms!**

### Presentation
This is a supplementary project to Matthew Fecher's ([@goFecher](http://twitter.com/goFecher)) presentation on Swift & Sprite Kit Game Design.

### Demo Music & Gfx

This starter template includes four (4) songs created as a part of an open-source Synthesizer project I am working on. Stay tuned!  You are free to use these background music songs in any of your apps. The graphics are just for demo purposes.

### Additional Library

This starter template includes Ray Wenderlich's excellent [SKTUtils Library](https://github.com/raywenderlich/SKTUtils). These routines include several helpful custom effects, math, conversion, and other useful Sprite Kit routines.
